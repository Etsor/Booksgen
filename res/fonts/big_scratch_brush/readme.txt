We are working on a new font digitization workflow, and Big Scratch Brush is our first experiment.

Big Scratch Brush is a big, thick, naturally dry brush font. It has a really raw texture, and uses a lot of points/curves. For powerful computers only, this is a big font.

Big Scratch Brush is offered for free, for both personal and commercial work. Have fun!
